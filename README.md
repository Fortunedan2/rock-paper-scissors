# rock-paper-scissors
I will be trying my hands on JavaScript by writing my first programm. I know it's not going to be a piece of cake, but there's no turning back now!

So far so good, I've successfully completed the Rock-Paper-Scissors project using my own approach and the problem solving skills learnt through the Odin Project.

It may not look like a great code, but I'm glad I put in my best to ensure its functionality!
